simple Keras based model for the [Distracted Drivers contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection)

train images should be extracted to data/train folder; test images - to data/test; cached images will be stored in data/cache

pipeline for image processing was borrowed from [ZFTurbo](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/KAGGLE_DISTRACTED_DRIVER)
